        <h2> Reflective Essay</h2>
        <p>I have always felt that qualities like perseverance, empathy, and self-discipline are important strengths or attributes in order to create a difference in terms of my relationship with others, how it affects my goals in life, and when moving forward. Perseverance enables me to persist in my academic goal despite the fights or challenges that I may face with some of our activities, quiz, and finals. When it comes to building better relationships, empathy helps me appreciate others’ viewpoints. It allowed me to put myself into their shoes and see what I would feel if I was put at their position which gives me a better understanding of what they could feel and what better solution I could provide for them. while self-discipline assists in efficient time management and settling on major goals. In the future, I intend to use these qualities in establishing fruitful relationships, accomplishing my educational goals and continuing to develop myself even more.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Parting Reflection</h1>
        <p>Before the school year started, I’ve always said to myself that no challenges will ever knock me down on my way to the greater future that I’ve always dreamed of.</p>
        <p>It was in August when the first day of my freshman year started. And the first time that I had heard about a subject called SSELEC or also known as “Social Science Elective”. At first, out of curiosity, I searched around on Google on what this subject was all about. It said that it’s a subject that allows students to understand how societies function, and it also exposes the students to many ideas and perspectives. </p>
        <p>And I thought, “ah this would be easy” and smirked. but little did I know that it would be the word that I will forever regret saying, because as the instructor started walking towards her desk, everybody became silent. She looked intimidating. And as days passed by, she would give us activities and quizzes which added to our workload, the same as the other minor subjects. (I can’t blame her; it is her job. )</p>
        <p>I asked myself as tons of activities have filled up. “These are just minor subjects, but why is it so hard?” Yes, we have days where we do not have classes. But is it really enough to finish all the tasks that were assigned to us? My previous school would always tell me that time management is the key. But for me, it’s really hard to manage my time, especially if there is something going on inside me. The battles inside. I sometimes think that it’s too much. Everything is too much. And that it’s not our instructors’ problem, but our education system.</p>
        <p>I started being distant from my loved ones, my friends, and my family. I was started to gain weight at the start of our vacation and started losing weight at the end of the first semester. I knew I wasn’t myself. Whenever I would feel pressure and stress, I would always pinch my wrist, arms, and legs and stopped until I was relieved. It started to become a hobby. I entered the school as a girl with a dream. and became the girl that was left all alone trying to push herself into finish all the activies that was given to her so that she could give more time to take care of herself again and regain her strength.</p>
        <p>One night I became so sick of the routine that I had and started to not just write the lessons that our SSE subject was teaching but to also apply it to myself. I started taking a break from everything. Instead of taking over the group activities, I started to let them. Instead of focusing on other people, I started to focus more on myself again. And little by little, I started to pick up the pieces that were part of me that I left along the way. </p>
        <p>As Seneca the Younger said, “There is no easy way from the Earth to the stars.” My journey in this subject has been a roller coaster: from individual activities, to semi-group work activities where most of the time I was the only one initiating into finishing our group works, and to a bunch of requirements needed in order to finish this subject. </p>
        <p>People often have bigger dreams in life, but we rarely find ourselves genuinely eager to face the challenges that lie ahead in pursuit of our goals. And if I came here as a girl with a dream, then I will come out as the woman that has learned a lot of things and is ready to move on into her next journey with bigger dreams.</p>
